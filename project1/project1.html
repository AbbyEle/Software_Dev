        <h2>What is a Church?</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>church</strong> is more than just a buildingâ€”it's a place of worship, community, and reflection. Churches serve as spiritual homes for Christians, offering a space for prayer, teaching, music, and fellowship. They are symbols of faith, unity, and cultural heritage across the globe.
        </p>

        <h3>Global Presence and Significance</h3>
        <p>
          Churches can be found on every continent, from historic cathedrals in Europe to small wooden chapels in remote villages. Many churches, such as St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City or the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, have stood for centuries and serve as important landmarks of architectural and spiritual significance. These sacred spaces often reflect the history, art, and traditions of the regions where they are built.
